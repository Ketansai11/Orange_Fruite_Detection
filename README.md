# Orange Disease Detection using YOLOv9

# Project Overview
This project uses YOLOv9 (You Only Look Once, version 9) to detect diseases in oranges. YOLOv9 is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its speed and accuracy.

# Before You Start
Ensure you have access to a GPU to speed up the training and inference process. You can check GPU availability through system commands and make necessary adjustments in your environment settings.

# Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies
YOLOv9 is a new model, and we recommend using a specific fork that includes important patches. You will need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies as specified in the repository's setup instructions.

# Install Roboflow
We use the roboflow package to download datasets from Roboflow Universe. Make sure to install this package to manage your datasets efficiently.

# Download Model Weights
Download the pre-trained weights for YOLOv9 models. These weights are necessary for running the detection model. Verify the weights are downloaded to the correct directory.

# Download Example Data
To run inference using example data, download an image from a reliable source. If you want to use your own image, upload it to the environment and update the file path accordingly.

# Inference
Run the model on the example image or your custom input. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the inference process and obtain detection results.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of YOLOv9 for detecting diseases in oranges. By following the setup instructions and using the provided scripts, you can train and run the model on your own data.

For further customization and improvement, refer to the YOLOv9 documentation and explore additional parameters and configurations.

This README file provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and guidance on how to run inference using the YOLOv9 model without including specific code snippets. Adjustments can be made based on additional specifics from the notebook or your preferences.
